# Neural PDEs for Chaotic Processes

This is the source code of the Neural Partial Differential Equations for Chaotic Processes Paper.

There are three main scripts here for the three NPDE setups of the article. In the scripts folder there are additionally needed functions and the data generation. In the comparisions folder there is the code for the hybrid reservoir and the CNN that the NPDE is compared to in the paper. The reservoir code is in Python.

## Additional Dependency

As an additional dependency the SeqData package from https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/SeqData.jl.git is needed.
